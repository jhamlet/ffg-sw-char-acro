Internationalization (i18n)
---------------------------

* [German](./README.de.md)

In the interest of making these available to the widest possible audience, I'm
working on a way to layout my illustrator files using JavaScript.

By incorporating a simple database of strings (eg. a JavaScript file) in the
script that lays out the page I can quickly create new versions with regionlized
strings.

### Translations

The illustrator template(s) and scripts will all be available in this repository
for your own use at some point. However, until I've finished the i18n scripts and
documented the process to run the various scripts in Illustrator® and Acrobat®,
it's probably easiest for others to translate database files and I generate the
localized version.

1. Fork this repository.

2. In your fork, copy the existing 'en.js' file inside the
   [lib/i18n/strings](lib/i18n/strings) directory and name it with the
   appropriate [BCP 47](BCP47) code (find a [discussion on language tags
   here][language-tags]).

3. At the top of the file are a couple of strings that need to be changed to
   reflect the current language, and any language that it is based on.

   The first is the one right after the `new Strings(`. This one sets the
   current language name. Use a BCP 47 code (i.e: 'fr', 'fr-CA', 'en-GB',
   etc...).

   The second is the commented out `base: 'en'` line. Un-comment that line.
   Unless you are creating a more regionalized version of the strings ('fr-CA',
   from 'fr') leave it as 'en', otherwise set it to the more generic language code.

4. When you are ready, issue a pull request for me to incorporate your changes.

5. Given my schedule, I will post the resulting PDFs as soon as I can.
